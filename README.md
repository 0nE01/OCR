### What is OCR?



#### OCR, or Optical Character Recognition, is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents or images taken by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. It identifies and extracts text characters from images, making it possible to edit and search the text. OCR is widely used for digitizing printed texts so they can be electronically stored, edited, and searched.
